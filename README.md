For our project we used two data sets, "RedditNews and DIJA". 

The RedditNews dataset consisted of 7 years worth of the top 25 news article headlines per day from Reddit's r/news channel. (Date,Title)

The DIJA data set consisted of 8 years worth of daily data from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Adj. Close)
